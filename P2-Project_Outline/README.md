Habit You Heard is a productivity app which reaffirms good habits and reprimands bad habits. Our app will help people who struggle with procrastination and maintaining daily routines, ensuring them to make the changes they want to their lifestyle.
Change is difficult for everyone especially in one's day-to-day life. Our app will help those who want to change, but don't know where to start. We all share the common goal of wanting to become better; however, some of us may have a harder time especially if they're easily discouraged when they fail to see their own progress or growth.
